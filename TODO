For a complete todo list, see bugzilla.buzzmaven.com.  Unfortunately, in a move from another hosting company, I lost my bugzilla database.  I recall a few of the issues, and more will come to light as I go.

* Assignment cloning from one group to another so that instructors can reuse assignments
* Community annotations, so that predefined annotations exist for instructors to choose from
* Change appearance of annotations based on reviewer's relationship to text (copy editor, content expert, etc.)
* A way for instructors to numerically rate a document based on criteria they define
* Convert all modules to Class::Accessor and Class::Fields for use with Object.pm
