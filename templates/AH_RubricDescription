<h2>About Rubrics</h2>
<p>In a traditional setting, a rubric is a guide for the instructor and the student.  It serves to communicate what criteria will be evaluated and how.  Rubrics cause students to pay attention to what is important in a document, and form a contract with the teacher.</p>
<p>In AnnotateIt!, the rubric is used to collect evaluation vectors, or individual qualities that need to be quantified.  A rubric in AnnotateIt! allows a teacher to collect a series of evaluation vectors and reuse them on different assignments.</p>
