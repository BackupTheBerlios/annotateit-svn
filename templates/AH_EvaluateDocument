<h2>What is this?</h2>

<p>This is the form that you use to evaluate a document.</p>

<h2>How do I?</h2>

<p>You need to have associated evaluation vectors to the document by
adding rubrics and evaluation vectors to the assignment in which the
document was uploaded.  When you have, just select the value you want
to assign to the document and save it.  The system will calculate
average or sum automatically depending on the rubric type you
chose.</p>




<table>
<tr>
<th>Eval Vector</th>
<th>Score</th>
<th>Weight</th>
<th>Weighted Score</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Grammar</td>
<td align="center">3</td>
<td align="center">1</td>
<td align="center">3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Audience Concern</td>
<td align="center">5</td>
<td align="center">10</td>
<td align="center">50</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>In the example above, the &quot;Audience Concern&quot; evaluation
vector is valued much more highly (ten times as much, actually) than
is the &quot;Grammar&quot; evaluation vector.  This results in a final
score of 53 for the Additive type, and 53/11 ~ 4.8.  As you can see,
the weights are reflected in the final calculation.</p>
