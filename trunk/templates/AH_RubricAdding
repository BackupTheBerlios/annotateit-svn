<h2>What is this?</h2>

<p>This is the form that you use to create a rubric.  A rubric is a
collection of evaluation vectors (which you must have already made in
order to create a collection of) that can be assigned to one or more
assignments.</p>

<h2>How do I?</h2>

<p>On this screen, you'll find a blank for the name of the rubric.
This is for you and the people who will be seeing the rubric.  You
should probably use something that is meaningful and understandable to
others as well.</p>

<p>Next to each of your evaluation vectors, there is a checkbox.  Check each evaluation vector that you want to include on the rubric.</p>

<p>You'll also find a select drop box for Rubric Type.  The rubric
type determines how the overall evaluation score is calculated.  At
the moment, AnnotateIt! only supports two types of evaluation scores.
The first, &quot;Additive&quot;, adds together all the weighted scores
for each of the evaluation vectors in the rubric.  The second, the
&quot;Average Type&quot; assumes all your evaluation vectors will have
the same range and average the weighted scores together.</p>

<p>When calculating the scores for each of the evaluation vectors, the
score you enter when you evaluate a document is weighted.  If you
leave the box empty, each evaluation vector will count for the same as
every other evaluation vector.  By increasing the value of the weight
of an evaluation vector in a rubric, you can increase the importance
of the evaluation vector in the calculation of the final calculation.
A weight of zero will be converted to a weight of one whn an
evaluation vector is selected. An example helps to illustrate.</p>

<table>
<tr>
<th>Eval Vector</th>
<th>Score</th>
<th>Weight</th>
<th>Weighted Score</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Grammar</td>
<td align="center">3</td>
<td align="center">1</td>
<td align="center">3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Audience Concern</td>
<td align="center">5</td>
<td align="center">10</td>
<td align="center">50</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>In the example above, the &quot;Audience Concern&quot; evaluation
vector is valued much more highly (ten times as much, actually) than
is the &quot;Grammar&quot; evaluation vector.  This results in a final
score of 53 for the Additive type, and 53/11 ~ 4.8.  As you can see,
the weights are reflected in the final calculation.</p>
