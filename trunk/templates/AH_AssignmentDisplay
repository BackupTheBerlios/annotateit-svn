<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p>This is the screen that lists the assignments that are pertinent to you. [% IF Assignments.size %]Below, you will see a list of your assignments.[% ELSE %]Since you don't have any assignments in the group you chose, you won't see a list of assignments yet.[% END %]The list shows the duedate, the title, which group the assignment is for, and who made the assignment.  You will also see a calendar.  To start with, it shows the previous month, this month, and next month. [% IF Assignments.size %]If there are any assignments due during the date range, you will see assignments listed by name in the calendar.[% END %]
</p>
<h2>What do I do with it?</h2>
<p>If you click on the title of the assignment, you will see the instructions for the assignment, as well as a list of documents submitted to the assignment, rubrics that pertain to the assignment, and evaluation vectors that pertain to the assignment.  Use this screen as a way to plan your workload.</p>
<p>If you want to see the assignments due in a different group, select which group (or &quot;All&quot; to see all your assignments).</p>
<p>The &quot;Previous Month&quot; and &quot;Next Month&quot; links move the calendar forward and back a month relative to the middle month shown.  For instance, if the months displayed are August, September, October and you click the &quot;Next Month&quot; the three months displayed will be September, October, November.  This is an easy way to see all the assignments due and past due at a glance.</p>

[% IF User.isTeacher %]
<p>Teachers will also see links for Editing (changing due date or title, instructions, rubric, evaluation vectors, etc), Cloning (copying an assignment's information and putting it on another day or group), and Deleting an assignment. If there are documents in the assignment, deleting it may not be a good idea.</p>
