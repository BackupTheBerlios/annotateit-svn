<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p>This is the screen you see when you have selected to delete an evaluation vector on a previous screen.  Below, if there are any, you'll see a list of objects and their ids that will be impacted by this delete, and consequently deleted also.  <strong>Only proceed if you are comfortable losing all of the objects listed.</strong></p>

<h2>What do I do with it?</h2>
<p>From here, you can either use your back button to get out of this screen, or push the &quot;Ok&quot; button, which will delete all of the objects listed and the evaluation vectors you chose.</p>
