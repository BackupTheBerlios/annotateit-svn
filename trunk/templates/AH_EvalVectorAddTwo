<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p>This is the second form of two that you need to fill out to create an evaluation vector.  Below you see the details of the evaluation vector, confirming what you just entered, then a rough preview of the evaluation vector under &quot;Looks Like&quot;, then a form where you can enter descriptions of the quantities you have selected for entry in the evaluation vector.</p>

<h2>What do I do with it?</h2>
<p>Add descriptions of what an author needs to do to earn the value in the Description box next to the Value.  For "select" types, it is wise to keep these descriptions short, as they are what you will see when you evaluate a document in the select.  The length of the descriptions matter less when the type is a radio or box.</p>
