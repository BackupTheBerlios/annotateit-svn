<h2>What is this?</h2>

<p>This is the first screen in the system that allows you to manage &quot;Evaluation Vectors&quot;.  In math and physics, a vector is a direction and a magnitude.  This model can be used to describe how people evaluate documents.  There is both a direction (or quality) and a magnitude (the value associated with it).An evaluation vector is how an evaluator can quantify a quality in a document.  An evaluation vector can be a holistic score, or it could be a component quality of a document.</p>

<h2>What do I do with it?</h2>

<p>If you need to evaluate assignments, and want to use the system to do it, add an evaluation vector (click the link below).  If you have evaluation vectors already, and want to edit them, click on the evaluation vector name, below.  If you want to delete an evaluation vector, click on the delete link, below.</p>
