<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p>This is the screen you see after you have successfully saved an evaluation vector.  Below, you can see an example of what your evaluation vector will look like when you go to evaluate a document.</p>

<h2>What do I do with it?</h2>
<p>From here, you can associate the evaluation vector with a rubric or an assignment, which you'll need to do if you want to use the evaluation vector.</p>
