Hey!  Welcome to the next release.  

Sometimes, the database schema are changed in between releases.  You
need to adjust your database to handle the new schema or you will get
many errors.  You can either run the commands
manually on your existing database, or create an entirely new database
to test with.  

We've supplied an sql difference file for between version changes to
the schema.  If you have already installed annotateit and want to just
get the differences between versions, you can use this file to change
your tables (and add new ones when appropriate).  From the command prompt, run

$ mysql -u (user) -p (annotateit database name) < v043-044.sql

The user and annotateit database name, you'll have to supply.  The
v043-044.sql is the difference between the databases found in version
0.4.3 and 0.4.4, for example.  All of these files are kept in the etc
directory of the distribution.
