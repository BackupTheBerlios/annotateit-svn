	- (Minor Feature) Moved saving to file for requests (which is
	possibly an artifact that is completely useless at this point due
	to the improved parsing routines) to saving to database for easier
	lookups and less issues with permissions... this should ease setup
	slightly.

	- (Minor Bugfix) Fixed Bug #1729 (Annotation Display is Off.
	Sites that have cascading style sheets linked to using the "link"
	tag should be vastly improved.
	
2004-03-29 jnerad

	- (Minor Optimization) in EvalVector.getDisplayData, instead of
	pulling a whole new User object, just lookup the information

	benchmark)
	
	- (Minor Bugfix) Problems with template in the addEvalVectors
	script.

	What a concept.  Also started with the Class::Accessor and
	Class::Fields modules.  This will make a huge difference in the
	readability and maintainability of the code.  I'd like to

2003-07-03 jnerad

	configuration file section.

	Annotation.pm use a test database
